How can that be switched on and off without modifying the test source?\r\n\r\nThe solution\r\n---------\r\nThis little library allows you to do that. It consists of only one class extending `junit.framework.TestCase` by a manager for temporary files and reads a configuration file describing where to place them and how long to let them live.\r\n\r\nHow to use it\r\n----------\r\nAs one might have already guessed it must be added to the classpath. Create a file named $HOME/.config/de.kandid/general.properties with two keys in it:\r\n\r\nProperty | Description | Default\r\n---------|-------------|----------\r\nde.kandid.junit.tmp.dir\t| the location where to create all temporary files and and directories | build/tmp/unittest\r\nde.kandid.junit.tmp.dir.remove | a TestCase.TmpDirDeletePolicy as a String controlling when to delete the files created for this TestCase\t| passed\r\n\r\nBuilding the kandidlib-junit.jar\r\n---------------------------\r\nThis library uses the [Gradle](http://gradle.org)-1.10 or later build system. Since I refuse to add the wrapper to the source code, you need to have it installed. Then\r\n```sh\r\ngradle jar\r\n```\r\nproduces the jar.\r\n\r\nImproving kandidlib-junit\r\n-------------\r\nOf course any IDE may be used to work on kandidlib-emitter but support for gradle makes it more convenient.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
